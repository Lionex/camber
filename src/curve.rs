//! n-degree Polynomial interpolation
//!
//! # Introduction
//!
//! Polynomial interpolation takes pairs of values _(t,f(t))_ and fits an
//! interpolating polynomial to those points.  In other words, it constructs a
//! polynomial that goes through a series of points _exactly_, with some
//! limitations.
//!
//! In some applications this is done to reconstruct some sort of
//! experimental data to get points between the originally sampled points.
//! Curve interpolation also often appears in computer graphics applications:
//! vector art software, as an example, essentially just interpolates curves
//! between points set by an artist.
//!
//! The methods here in some way or another satisfy the following conditions on
//! their interpolating polynomials _p(x)_: given a point _t_ and some value
//! _f(t)_, _p(t) == f(t)_.  Don't forget that _p(x)_ does not necessarily equal
//! _f(x)_ in between the interpolating points.  For further reading see
//! [Runge's Phenomenon][1] and UC Davis's comprehensive
//! [_On-Line Geometric Modeling Notes_][2].

/// Create a bernstein polynomial _B(t)_ defined for _0 <= t <= 1_
///
/// For any degreen n, n+1 bernstein polynomials exist.  Summing all of them
/// together for any _t_ where _0 <= t <= 1_ results in a value of one.  These
/// polynomials often serve as belnding functions for a curve that interpolates
/// _n+1_ points with a polynomial of degree _n_.
///
/// - `n`: the degree of the berinstein polynomial
/// - `k`: identifies a particular bernstein polynomial where _0 <= k <= n_
/// - `t`: the specific point at which to evaluate the polynomial.
///
/// Notable properties of the Bernstein Polynomials include:
/// - All Bernstein polynomials are Non-Negative from _0 <= t <= 1_
/// - Any of the lower-degree Bernstein polynomials (degree < n) can be
///   expressed as a linear combination of Bernstein polynomials of degree n
/// - Derivatives of the _n_th degree Bernstein polynomials are polynomials of
///   degree _nâˆ’1_.
///
/// For a more comprehensive discussion, see [Kenneth Joy's notes.][1]
