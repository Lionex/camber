# Camber

> **Camber**: _v._ to curve 

Camber is a curve interpolation library.

As it stands, this library is an exercise in implementing the following types of polynomial interpolations:

- Lagrange Divided Difference
- Cubic Curves
- Hermite Curves
- Cubic Bezier Curves
- Bezier Curve truncation
- Catmull-Rom Splines
- Cubic Splines
- B-Splines
- Uniform B Splines
- Non-Uniform B Splines
- Non-Uniform Rational B Splines

If I'm successful and figure out an interesting or particularly useful interface for this library, I might make it into a serious project.
